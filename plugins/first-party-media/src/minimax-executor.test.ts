/**
 * MiniMax, translated rather than waited on.
 *
 * The host used to do this inline, with a loop of 180 attempts five seconds apart. Fifteen minutes
 * was the most generous of the seven hand-written ceilings in that file and none of them came from
 * anywhere; the job id lived in a local variable, so a host that stopped mid-loop lost a generation
 * that had already been billed.
 *
 * Split in two, neither half waits. How often to ask, and for how long, stops being MiniMax's
 * opinion.
 *
 * MiniMax is the first ported provider that does not queue everything. Its audio endpoints answer
 * in the same call with the bytes inline, so there is nothing to poll and no id to poll it with.
 * That path returns `completed` from submit, which is what the protocol says a synchronous provider
 * does — inventing a poll cycle for it would mean inventing an identifier MiniMax never issued.
