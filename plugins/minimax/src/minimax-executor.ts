/**
 * MiniMax's generation APIs, as two translations.
 *
 * MiniMax answers in two different ways depending on what is being made. Video goes on a queue and
 * comes back as a task id to ask about; audio comes back in the same call with the bytes inline.
 * Both shapes live here, and neither waits — `minimaxSubmit` sends the work and reports whichever
 * answer MiniMax gave, `minimaxPoll` asks once about a queued task. The host decides how often to
 * ask and for how long.
 *
 * That decision used to live in the host as a loop of 180 attempts five seconds apart. Fifteen
 * minutes was the most generous of seven hand-written ceilings, none of them derived from anything,
 * and the task id lived in a local variable, so a host that stopped mid-loop lost a generation that
 * had already been billed.
 */

 * MiniMax addresses a task by id and nothing else.
 *
 * No endpoint travels alongside it, as fal's does, and no model: the query path is the same for
 * every video model. Adding the model here because it happens to be available would be a second
 * copy of something the node already records, free to disagree with the first.
