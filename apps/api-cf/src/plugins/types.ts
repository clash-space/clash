/**
 * Plugin surface for api-cf.
 *
 * Default OSS deployments register no plugins → all hooks are no-op,
 * behavior is identical to "no plugin system at all".
 *
 * Hosted (or any downstream) deployments register plugins (e.g. the
 * billing plugin in packages/billing) to inject pre/post-generation
 * checks, route extensions, key resolution, quota enforcement, etc.
 *
 * Hooks are resolved lazily via getPlugins() at call sites — see
 * registry.ts for the lookup mechanism. This keeps the plugin
 * indirection out of OSS hot paths when no plugins are registered.
