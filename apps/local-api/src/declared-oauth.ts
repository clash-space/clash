 * plugin Provider regardless of what it declared.

 * What replaces the registry is not a shorter list of vendors. It is reading the flow the Provider
 * already states, and letting the host supply everything that repeats: PKCE, `state`, the loopback
 * port, the timeout and the token exchange all live in `auth-flow.ts`. What comes from here is the
 * address to open and the vendor's own parameters.
