/**
 * A second live host must not silently take over the discovery record.
 *
 * The record is a single `host.json` replaced by rename, so a newly started host displaced
 * a running one without either noticing. Both kept serving on their own random ports, and
 * clients followed whichever wrote last. Asset URLs already handed out pointed at the
 * displaced port, so inlining a reference failed with a bare `fetch failed` while the
 * upstream was reachable and the log showed two ports:
 *
 *   [local-api] listening on http://127.0.0.1:49321
 *   [local-api] listening on http://127.0.0.1:55799
 *
 * A takeover is only legitimate when the recorded pid is gone.
