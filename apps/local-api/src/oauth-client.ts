 * The OAuth client belongs to the host, and the plugin never sees it.

 * A client id is the *application's* identity with a vendor. Google issued Clash's, not a plugin's.
 * A plugin holding the client secret could mint its own authorization requests against Clash's
 * registration, and every token it obtained would look to the vendor like Clash asking.
 *
 * So the host runs the whole exchange and writes only the resulting token into the plugin's store.
 * What a plugin can read is a credential for the account; what it cannot read is the credential that
 * identifies Clash.
