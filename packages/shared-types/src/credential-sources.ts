/**
 * Credential sources, normalized.
 *
 * A provider's auth declaration answers one question -- how does a credential for
 * this provider get here -- and consumers need two distinctions from the answer:
 *
 *   - which control renders it: a field, a button that opens a window, or a button
 *     that calls the host
 *   - whether it needs a human present, which is what decides if a headless or CI
 *     caller can use it at all
 *
 * That second axis is the one Kubernetes standardized as `interactiveMode` on exec
 * credential plugins, and it is the axis this product was missing: a provider whose
 * only route to a credential is a browser window has no unattended path, which used
 * to be invisible until a CLI run failed.
 *
 * What changed is where the distinctions come from. They used to be read off a union
 * over auth *types* -- `api-key`, `oauth`, `derived-token`, `local-token-import` --
 * and each new vendor needed a new member, which meant editing the host to add a
 * provider. One vendor signs each request with an access key and a secret, another wants a
 * token copied from a console, and Google accepts several credential forms; none
 * of them is a type the host should have to learn.
 *
 * The declaration already carries both distinctions without naming any of that. A
 * form item's `kind` says which control to draw, and the presence of a `flow` says a
 * browser window is involved. So this file now reads the declaration rather than
 * classifying vendors, and a new vendor is a new declaration rather than a new host
 * release.

   * is obtained and never carries the result, so code cannot persist a minted token
