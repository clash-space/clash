/**
 * The two Google surfaces a key can be spent on.
 *
 * `ai-studio` is the Gemini Developer API, keyed from aistudio.google.com. `agent-platform` is
 * Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform — the product formerly called Vertex AI — which now accepts an
 * API key as well, rather than only a service-account JSON signed into a scoped token.
 *
 * Because both take the same kind of credential, the credential can no longer tell them apart. The
 * account has to say, exactly as a MiniMax account says which service issued its key. Getting it
 * wrong is not a degraded result: the hosts are unrelated and the request comes back as an
 * authentication failure naming neither the surface nor the host.
