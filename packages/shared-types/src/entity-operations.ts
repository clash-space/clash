/**
 * Everything a plugin can do to an entity, as a closed set.
 *
 * Two first-party plugins each grew one command per verb -- `timeline create/attach/detach/render`
 * and `director create/attach/detach/capture` -- and inspecting them shows only three distinct
 * shapes. `pull` and `apply` are the projection loop, identical for every editable entity and
 * already generic. `render` and `capture` are the same operation under two names: an entity plus
 * parameters produces an asset. What is left is lifecycle, which reads the same whatever the entity
 * is.
 *
 * Producing is absent on purpose. The canvas already has one mechanism for it: a node carries
 * parameters and, when executed, spawns a pending asset child. An action badge does this with a
 * Model Card's parameters; a `video-editor` node does it with `data.timelineId`, and executing one
 * spawns a pending `render-video` child. `timeline render` is that same path reached through a
 * second command, which is why it has its own receipt, its own waiting, and its own flags.
 *
 * So an entity does not declare that it produces. It declares the canvas node it appears as, and
 * producing is `canvas execute` on that node -- inheriting the pending-node lifecycle, the provider
 * accounting, and the CAS treatment that generations already have.
 *
 * Closed rather than free-form for the same reason a projection `source` is closed: the host owns
 * what each operation means, who may run it, and how its result enters the CAS. A plugin naming its
 * own verb would be declaring behaviour the host cannot reason about. `clash production` is the
 * cautionary case: forty-four subcommands, each a verb, all eventually deleted.
