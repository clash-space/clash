/**
 * A plugin id is `publisher.name`.
 *
 * The same shape VS Code settled on -- `ms-python.python`, `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint` -- and for the
 * same reason: the publisher segment is what makes two people's `google` plugin two plugins rather
 * than a collision. Ours are `clash.google` and `clash.minimax`.
 *
 * The version is not part of the id. An updated plugin is the same plugin, which is what lets a
 * route bound to `clash.google` keep working across an upgrade. It also means the id is an identity
 * and not a permission: whoever publishes the next version publishes under the same name, so what
 * an id is good for is telling two plugins apart, not deciding what one is allowed to do.
