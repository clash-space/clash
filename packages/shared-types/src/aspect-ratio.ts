 * A ratio is two numbers.
 *
 * It was a string, which meant every comparison was a spelling comparison: "16:9" and "1920:1080"
 * describe one shape and matched nothing, "16x9" was a different value again, and anything a vendor
 * spelled its own way needed a translation table per vendor. Two integers reduce, compare and
 * divide, and a custom shape is expressible without inventing a menu entry for it.
 *
 * What this deliberately does not do is decide whether a model accepts the shape. Vendors take a
 * closed set — MiniMax rejects `adaptive` and takes six ratios, Agent Platform rejects everything
 * outside its own list — so an arbitrary pair still has to be checked against the model. Snapping to
 * the nearest supported ratio would be a silent substitution, which is the failure this codebase
 * spent the day removing.
