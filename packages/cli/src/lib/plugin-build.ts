/**
 * Compiling a plugin entrypoint.
 *
 * The host owns this step rather than the plugin author, for the same reason it owns
 * the launch argv: the sandbox imposes requirements the author would otherwise have
 * to remember. A plugin runs as
 *
 *     node --permission --allow-fs-read=<pluginDir> --import=<network-guard> <entrypoint>
 *
 * so there is no module resolution and no loader hook available. The artifact must
 * therefore be one self-contained ESM file with only `node:` builtins left external.
 * Those are not stylistic choices, and putting them in a per-plugin bundler config
 * means a mistake surfaces as an opaque failure inside the sandbox.
 *
 * Which entrypoints are derived is declared by `runtime.build.source`. When it is
 * absent the entrypoint was authored directly -- the ordinary case for Python, where
 * the source is what runs -- and the host never overwrites it.
