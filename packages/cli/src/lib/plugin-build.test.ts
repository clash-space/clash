/**
 * `dist/` is a derived artifact, so keeping it current is the host's job.
 *
 * The project already applies this rule to concurrency: read-presence and CAS happen
 * inside mutation commands rather than through a token the agent must remember. A
 * separate build step has the same shape and a worse failure. Editing `src/` without
 * rebuilding leaves `validate` reporting `valid: true`, the contract tests passing
 * against the previous bundle, and `activate` storing stale logic under a fresh
 * content hash -- verified on a real draft before this existed. Nothing in that
 * sequence looks wrong.
 *
 * Which entrypoints are derived is declared, not guessed: `runtime.build.source`
 * says so. Absent means the entrypoint was authored by hand and the host must never
 * overwrite it, which is the normal case for Python.
